# EasyOpenVR
This is a C# submodule to make it easier to talk to the OpenVR API (WIP)

## Disclaimer
I'm only making this as to collect all the things I've figured out and used in a plethora of private projects, I'm not a C# programmer by trade, so I expect many of the things I've implemented to have much better solutions, this is more of a "get something done at all" project.

## Usage
For this to work, I'm just adding it as a submodule to a project that already has the openvr.dll and openvr.cs files from [Valve](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr). More instructions will come later when I've actually got this up and running.
